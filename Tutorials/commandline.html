	<h2>What is the command line?</h2>
	<p> The command line is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the 	form of successive lines of text (command lines). The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems until the 		introduction of the video display terminal in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on OpenVMS, Unix 		systems and personal computer systems including MS-DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS. The interface is usually implemented with a command line 		shell, which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands to appropriate operating system functions.
